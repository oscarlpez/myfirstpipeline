# My First Pipeline
## _A simple exercise for building a CI/CD pipeline_

Describes a simple exercise to configure a CI/CD pipeline using CircleCI and to code test build and deploy a python application.

- Python code testing with flake8, which checks code base against coding style (PEP8) programming errors
- Python testing using pytest, which enables to write unit tests and excute the tests 


## Steps

- GitHub code repository
    - example.py
    - test_example.py (unit test)
    - pytest 
    - flake8
- CircleCI 
    - config.yml
